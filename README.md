# 3D Garment Reconstruction From Single View Image 

## Introduction
This project aims to reconstruct 3D garment meshes from single-view RGB images while enabling latent attribute editing for the generation of diverse 3D garment variations.

## Motivation
3D garment reconstruction is crucial for realistic virtual environments in gaming, fashion, and e-commerce. By leveraging latent vector representations, we can manipulate clothing styles.
